# DPA3070ModelingProject
This was my first project where I modelled every object, textured each object, and added lighting.

I could not include the entire Maya project because it is too big, but the pictures are of the textured and lit environment I created from scratch. 
This took me about 3 weeks and was my first time modelling.
